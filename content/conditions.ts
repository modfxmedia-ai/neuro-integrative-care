When any falter, from stress, poor sleep, blood-sugar swings, or low-grade inflammation, cognition suffers long before anything shows on a standard test. A 19-channel QEEG brain map reveals more about how your brain actually operates than you've ever seen, and shows exactly where to train.

Our functional-neurology assessment maps exactly which circuits were affected, then builds active rehab: vestibular and oculomotor retraining, autonomic regulation, and violet-laser support for mitochondrial healing. By Dr. Santucci's estimate, up to half of men are walking around with unaddressed post-concussive syndrome.",
